This folder includes example code with possible steps to follow when a joint model did not converge with default settings.
Note that we only illustrate this for a joint model assuming the constant intervention parametrisation, but the steps generalise to other settings as well.

Specifically, we mix code and prose in the [`04-non-convergence.md`](04-non-convergence.md) to analyse the data in [`04-data.dta`](04-data.dta).
The source code of the document (written using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org) publishing system) is in [`04-non-convergence.qmd`](04-non-convergence.qmd); reproducibility of the document requires a Python environment that is properly setup to use `jupyter` and the `nbstata` kernel, e.g., using virtual environments with `venv`.
